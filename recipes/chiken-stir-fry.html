  <li>1 tablespoon garlic</li>
  <li>1 onion</li>

<p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
<ol>
    <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.
         Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
          and simmer until rice is tender,
           and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium glass or ceramic bowl;
         stir until smooth.
         Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat.
         Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.</li>       
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.
         Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper;
          cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes.
           Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high heat.
         Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side;
          stir in vegetables and reserved marinade.
           Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
            Serve over rice.</li>
